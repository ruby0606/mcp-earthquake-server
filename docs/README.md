## 🌍 Integrated Data Sources

The MCP Earthquake Server provides access to authoritative geophysical data:

- **USGS** - Real-time earthquake feeds, ShakeMap data, and seismic hazard assessments
- **IRIS** - Seismological waveform data and global station networks  
- **GNSS Networks** - GPS displacement monitoring from Nevada Geodetic Laboratory and global networks
- **Sentinel-1 SAR** - Satellite radar interferometry via Alaska Satellite Facility DAAC

All integrations provide real-time access to scientific data for comprehensive earthquake monitoring.
