## MCP Server for IRIS Seismological and GNSS Earthquake Data

This project creates a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to:
- IRIS seismological data (earthquake catalogs, waveforms)
- GNSS/GPS station data for crustal deformation monitoring
- Real-time earthquake monitoring capabilities
- Data analysis and visualization tools

### Key Features:
- Fetch earthquake data from IRIS web services
- Access GNSS station displacement data
- Real-time data streaming
- Data processing and analysis tools
- Integration with earthquake prediction models

### Technology Stack:
- TypeScript/Node.js for MCP server
- IRIS web services API integration
- UNAVCO/GNSS data APIs
- WebSocket for real-time data
- Data visualization libraries
